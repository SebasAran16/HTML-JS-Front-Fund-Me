1. HTML / JavaScript

    This is my first project Full Stack done by the course of Patrick Collins and FreeCodeCamp. I am really gratefull for all the knowledge I have been able to get from this course and will appreciate this forever!

    This is very minimalistic, but later repos will be more advanced!
